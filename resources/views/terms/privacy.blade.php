                We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. 
                As with any internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, 
                so it’s important to protect your password and to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized access
                to your account. 
          </div>

          <p>
            Calamus takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or 
            destruction of your personal data that we collect and store. These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity 
            of the data. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications 
            between you and Calamus, the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the data we collect 
            through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Your password is an important 
            part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. You should not share your 
            password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, 
            you should change it immediately and contact our Support Team with any concerns.
