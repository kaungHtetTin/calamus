            <h2>1. Accounts</h2>
            <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding:7px;margin:7px;">
              You need an account for most activities on our platform. Keep your password somewhere safe, 
              because you’re responsible for all activity associated with your account. If you suspect someone else is
              using your account, let us know by contacting our Support Team. You must have reached the age of consent for
              online services in your country to use Calamus
            </div>

            <p>
              You need an account for most activities on our platform, including to purchase and access content or to 
              submit content for publication. When setting up and maintaining your account,
               you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address.
                You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including 
                for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account without your permission.
                 This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or 
                 use someone else’s account. If you contact us to request access to an account, we will
                  not grant you such access unless you can provide us with the information that we need to prove you are
                   the owner of that account. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be closed. 
            </p>

        <div class="div" id="content-enroll">
          <h2>2. Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access </h2>
          <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding:7px;margin:7px;">
              When you enroll in a course or other content, you get a license from us to view it via the Calamus
              Services and no other use. Don’t try to transfer or resell content in any way. 
              We generally grant you a lifetime access license, except when we must disable the content because of legal or 
              policy reasons or for enrollments via Subscription Plans. 
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="div" id="payments">
          <h2>3. Payments</h2>
          <p>When you make a payment, you agree to use a valid payment method. We receive the payments from mobile banking in Myanmar
            such as KBZ Pay, Wave Pay and Mytel Pay. So we do not save any payment method of the students.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="div" id="content-rule">
          <h2>4. Content and Behavior Rules  </h2>
          <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding:7px;margin:7px;">
            You can only use Calamus for lawful purposes. You’re responsible for all the content that you post on our platform.
             You should keep the reviews, questions, posts, courses and other content you upload in 
             line with our Trust & Safety Guidelines and the law, and respect the intellectual property rights of others. 
             We can ban your account for repeated or major offenses. If you think someone is infringing your copyright 
             on our platform, let us know. 
          </div>

          <p>
            You may not access or use the Services or create an account for unlawful purposes. 
            Your use of the Services and behavior on our platform must comply with applicable local or national laws or
             regulations of your country. You are solely responsible for the knowledge of and compliance with such laws 
             and regulations that are applicable to you. 
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are a student, the Services enable you to ask questions to the instructors of courses or other
             content you are enrolled in, and to post reviews of content. For certain content, 
             the instructor may invite you to submit content as “homework” or tests. Don’t post or submit
              anything that is not yours. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="div" id="content-right">
          <h2>5. Calamus's Rights to Content You Post  </h2>
          <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding:7px;margin:7px;">
            You retain ownership of content you post to our platform.
             We’re allowed to share your content to anyone through any media, 
             including promoting it via advertising on other websites. 
          </div>

          <p>
            The content you post as a student remains yours. By posting content, 
            you allow Calamus to reuse and share it but you do not lose any ownership rights you may have over your content.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you post content, comments, questions, reviews, and when you submit to us ideas and suggestions for 
            new features or improvements, you authorize Calamus to use and share this content with anyone, distribute it and promote it on any platform and in any media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="div" id="own-risk">
          <h2>6. Using Calamus at Your Own Risk </h2>
          <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding:7px;margin:7px;">
            Anyone can use Calamus to create and publish content and instructors and we enable instructors and students
             to interact for teaching and learning. Like other platforms where people can post content and interact, 
             some things can go wrong, and you use Calamus at your own risk. 
          </div>

          <p>
            Our platform model means we do not review or edit the content for legal issues, and we are not in a 
            position to determine the legality of content. We do not exercise any editorial control over the content 
            that is available on the platform and, as such, do not guarantee in any manner the reliability, validity, 
            accuracy, or truthfulness of the content. If you access content, you rely on any information provided by 
            an instructor at your own risk. 
          </p>

          <p>
            By using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive, indecent, or objectionable. 
            Calamus has no responsibility to keep such content from you and no liability for your access or enrollment
             in any course or other content, to the extent permissible under applicable law.
              This also applies to any content relating to health, wellness, and physical exercise. 
              You acknowledge the inherent risks and dangers in the strenuous nature of these types of content, 
              and by accessing such content you choose to assume those risks voluntarily, including risk of illness,
               bodily injury, disability, or death. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during,
                and after your access to the content. 
          </p>

          <p>
            When you interact directly with a student or an instructor, you must be careful about the types of personal 
            information that you share. While we restrict the types of information instructors may request from students, 
            we do not control what students and instructors do with the information they obtain from other users 
            on the platform. You should not share your email or other personal information about you for your safety. 
          </p>
